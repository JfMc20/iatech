# Implementation Plan - Project Cleanup & Code Standardization

## Task Execution Guidelines

### Prerequisites for Each Task
- Ensure Git working directory is clean before starting
- Create checkpoint commits after completing major tasks
- Run tests after significant changes to catch regressions
- Document any issues or blockers encountered

### Quality Gates
- **After Task 4**: All ESLint errors must be resolved
- **After Task 6**: TypeScript compilation must succeed without errors
- **After Task 10**: Bundle size should show measurable improvement
- **After Task 17**: All tests must pass and application must function correctly

### Success Criteria
- Project passes all linting checks without errors
- Package.json contains only necessary dependencies
- Build process completes successfully with optimized output
- Documentation accurately reflects current project state
- Performance metrics show improvement over baseline

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Strategy
- Git checkpoints created before each major phase
- Package.json backup maintained throughout process
- Ability to revert individual changes if issues arise
- Test validation after each significant modification

### Validation Steps
- Continuous testing during cleanup process
- Manual verification of critical functionality
- Performance benchmarking at key milestones
- Security validation after dependency updates
