# Requirements Document - Project Cleanup & Code Standardization

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical need for a comprehensive audit and cleanup of the IATECH frontend codebase. The project has accumulated technical debt, inconsistencies, and outdated dependencies that need to be resolved before implementing new features. This cleanup initiative will establish a clean, stable, documented, and properly configured foundation that serves as a prerequisite for all future development.

The cleanup will focus on:
- **Code Quality Standardization** through consistent linting and formatting
- **Dependency Management** by removing unused packages and updating critical dependencies
- **Documentation Updates** to reflect the current project state
- **Configuration Optimization** for development and production environments
- **Technical Debt Reduction** through refactoring and code improvements
